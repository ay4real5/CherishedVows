Schedule
Our Wedding is on Saturday 21st March 2026. The ceremony will promptly start from 11:00am and we aim to end the after party before 11:00pm.
When should I RSVP by?
To help us with our planning, please RSVP as soon as possible. However, we would appreciate if this is done by 28th February 2026.
When should I arrive to the ceremony?
You should aim to arrive at least 15 minutes before the ceremony starts. This gives you plenty of time to find a seat, settle in, and avoid any last-minute disruptions. Arriving any later could risk missing the start of the ceremony or interrupting key moments. It's always better to be early than to rush and potentially miss out!
Are Children Welcome?
As much as we love your little ones, our wedding is exclusively for adults. Thank you for understanding üòä.
Is there a parking area at the venue?
Yes, there is plenty of free parking available at the venue.

Yes! We would love for you to take photos and share them with us.
However, please don‚Äôt block the walkway during dance entrance and be conscious of the photographers and videographers.
Can I bring a date?
Please only bring a plus one if this has been confirmed with the Bride and Groom or their Parents.
Seating will be allocated to ensure guests feel comfortable and have their own seats. We hope you understand üòä.

Can I cancel my RSVP?
If your plans have changed and you are unable to attend after previously confirming, please tell us as soon as possible. This will allow us to accommodate other guests and make any necessary adjustments.
