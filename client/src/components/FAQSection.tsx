      question: "What is the schedule for the wedding day?",

    {
      question: "When should I arrive to the ceremony?",
      answer: "You should aim to arrive at least 15 minutes before the ceremony starts. This gives you plenty of time to find a seat, settle in, and avoid any last-minute disruptions. Arriving any later could risk missing the start of the ceremony or interrupting key moments. It's always better to be early than to rush and potentially miss out!",
