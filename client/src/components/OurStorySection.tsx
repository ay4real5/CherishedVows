                Aduki and I have been through many ups and downs, and each one has only made us stronger, closer, and more certain of what we share.

                She's an incredibly good person, smart, ambitious and focused.

                With her, life feels fuller, brighter, and more beautiful than I ever imagined. I don't just want to spend my days with her, I want to grow, laugh, dream, and face everything together. She is my heart, my home, and my forever.

                Abisoye has shown me the importance of having a loving relationship. Over the years our love has grown into something truly special. I have discovered that the best part of life is simply being by his side.
